To use the **API Int IO**, you don't need much:  

- **Code for identification:**  
  - Create a Web3 Ethereum private key compatible with MetaMask.  
  - Sign a message using the private key.  
  - Verify a given signed message.  

- **Code to push network packages:**  
  - Use **UDP** for actions without identification.  
  - Use **WebSocket** for actions requiring authentication.  

 Youâ€™ll find some Rust code you can use on your computer to implement these features.
