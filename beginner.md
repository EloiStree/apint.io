Hello to you :)

You are new and want to play with us or use the API Int IO.
You are at the right place.

I will just show you some basic example here.
_A more elaborate tutorial will be created later._

You can interact with us by Twitch chat at anytime or by Discord.
- Chat Only: https://www.twitch.tv/popout/eloiteaching/chat?popout=
- Chat and stream: https://www.twitch.tv/eloiteaching

You can also interact from the Discord bot and Discord server:
- Discord: [Chat](https://discord.gg/YDYqKKwXAt)| [https://discord.gg/YDYqKKwXAt](https://discord.gg/YDYqKKwXAt)

To send a integer to the stream, you can write those line:
- `!i1300 !i2300` : Press A on Xbox, Release A on Xbox

As a guest you ask to send the command 1300 and 2300 from the map index here:

You have seral type of game.
- Some where we allows all to play without identification
- Some where only the authentifiedd player can play
- Some where only 1-4 player can play to make some tournament on some game.
- An other concept.

You will need to sign in to use APInt.

Our login systm use MetaMask that is amazing ethereum tool for web browser.
But as most of the players won't use MetaMask at start.

The tool works also without it.
