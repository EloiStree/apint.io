# About 

[![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ac2569a-7018-4d98-be9a-2f9eeffdfd9c)](https://github.com/EloiStree/License)  

My name is Ã‰loi StrÃ©e, and Iâ€™m a Belgian developer working on integer-based tools designed to enable remote control functionality for gaming, QA testing, and "integer massive multiplayer games." Inspired deeply by the Twitch Plays PokÃ©mon phenomenon, creating a game of that nature is a personal dream of mine.

API Integer IO is a landing page showcasing code centered around integers and serving as a gateway to small integer servers used for remote control purposes. For authentication, I use [MetaMaskðŸ¦Š](https://metamask.io) and [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io) as the login system.

Hosting remote control games across multiple computers, especially when theyâ€™re not in the same location, can be a real headache. It becomes even more challenging when you're not a tech-savvy person, dealing with fixed IPs and open ports in environments where you often lack admin privileges.

The idea here is to trade off some lag for the sake of simplicity in connectivity.

If youâ€™re a fan of IFTTT, Iâ€™d love your help in building what I have in mind. The goal is simple: share integers between devices you own. This foundational concept can enable you to create your own IFTTT-like system. Just grab a Raspberry Pi, connect it to a shared integer server, and youâ€™ve got a computer that can perform actions based on integers sent from any of your devices.

In short: letâ€™s see what I can build!

Have a nice day, may the code be with you.




# Cross-Platform Interaction

APIntIO serves as a cross-platform API, designed with a MetaMask-signed and verified concept. 
Below are examples of bot code designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 5:
- **Twitch Bot**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/EloiStree/2024_12_11_HelloMegaMaskTwitchBot)  
- **Discord Bot**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/EloiStree/2024_12_07_HelloMegaMaskDiscordBot)


 -------------------------------

# Warning Agreement

## I store the authentication information in a public Git repository  

**Warning:** I cannot guarantee the privacy and security of your data.  
I lack the competence and expertise to ensure this.

When you link a MetaMask public address with a platform, it is stored in this public Git repository:  
- [https://github.com/EloiStree/MetaMaskUsersAPIntIo](https://github.com/EloiStree/MetaMaskUsersAPIntIo)  

The data is then placed in a database in this exact format to make it easier to access.  
This is the only data related to your identity that I store.

We cannot remove data from a Git project (or prevent leaks of a database in the case of a private company).  
If you don't want your Twitch account to be linked to your Discord account through a unique ID in the database,  
please minimize your use of the service or refrain from using it altogether.



## DDoS, Hackers, Trolls, and Stability  

I am just a small game developer, and I don't plan to grow this project to a level where I can guarantee its operability 24/7.  
- It is likely to go down due to DDoS attacks.  
- It may be hacked by people who dislike the project, the use of the tool, or me.  
- It will probably be trolled by the Twitch community ðŸ˜‹.  
- It might crash because I am not great at my job.  
- It is going to be down when we do some stress test with thousands of player

I will do my best, but please do not consider this project to be stable.
