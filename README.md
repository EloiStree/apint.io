My name is Ã‰loi StrÃ©e, and Iâ€™m a Belgian developer working on integer-based tools designed to enable remote control functionality for gaming, QA testing, and "integer massive multiplayer games." Inspired deeply by the Twitch Plays PokÃ©mon phenomenon, creating a game of that nature is a personal dream of mine.

API Integer IO is a landing page showcasing code centered around integers and serving as a gateway to small integer servers used for remote control purposes. For authentication, I use [MetaMaskðŸ¦Š](https://metamask.io) and [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io) as the login system.

Hosting remote control games across multiple computers, especially when theyâ€™re not in the same location, can be a real headache. It becomes even more challenging when you're not a tech-savvy person, dealing with fixed IPs and open ports in environments where you often lack admin privileges.

The idea here is to trade off some lag for the sake of simplicity in connectivity.

If youâ€™re a fan of IFTTT, Iâ€™d love your help in building what I have in mind. The goal is simple: share integers between devices you own. This foundational concept can enable you to create your own IFTTT-like system. Just grab a Raspberry Pi, connect it to a shared integer server, and youâ€™ve got a computer that can perform actions based on integers sent from any of your devices.

In short: letâ€™s see what I can build!

Have a nice day, may the code be with you.
