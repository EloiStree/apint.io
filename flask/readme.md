Find in this folder some Flask code install on the apint.io Raspberry Pi server.

All I want is to run some REST API for basic action:
- Create ETH Key
- Sign message
- Verify message

But they will be probably more if I find some generic useful code to add.


If you want to run your own server, fell free to  copy the code.
