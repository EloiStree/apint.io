This are some simple JavaScript code for a static webpage with a form, designed without any complex code.

The pages need to be able to perform some ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) actions, either with or without MetaMask.

Since the API server uses MetaMask-based ECC authentication, I also need tools that can be used by people who aren't familiar with coding or programming.

You'll find basic code snippets for a static JavaScript page to help you interact with the apint.io server without any coding experience.
