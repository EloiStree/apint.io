By create, MetaMask wallet, I means a compatible with MetaMask.  
However, if you need to create a MetaMask-compatible wallet for any reason (e.g., as a temporary key or a buffer key), you can do so here. Below, I will provide JavaScript code that generates a random wallet, which can be imported into MetaMask.
